# Ebay Perfume - A Cinematic Landing Page Experience

Welcome to the official repository for the **Ebay Perfume** landing page, a modern, single-page web experience designed to be both visually stunning and highly interactive.

This project was brought to life using the **Gemini CLI tool**, a cutting-edge assistant for software development. The entire layout, from the hero section to the footer, was bootstrapped by providing a single design image to the AI, which then generated the foundational code.

## ✨ The Genesis: From Image to Reality

This project serves as a powerful demonstration of AI-assisted development. The core structure and style were generated by the Gemini CLI based on a visual prompt—a `.JPG` image of the desired layout. 

The process was as follows:
1.  **Provide the Image:** We gave the Gemini CLI a target design.
2.  **AI Scaffolding:** The tool analyzed the image and generated the complete HTML structure, Tailwind CSS classes, and even placeholder animations with GSAP.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** From the solid foundation provided by the AI, we then customized and extended the site, adding more complex animations and sections to build the final, polished product.

This project is a testament to how developers can leverage AI to accelerate the initial, often time-consuming, phases of web development and focus more on creative and technical refinement.
